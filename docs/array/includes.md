## Check if array includes all values

Checks if all the elements in `values` are included in `arr`.

- Use `Array.prototype.every()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` to check if all elements of `values` are included in `arr`.

```js
const includesAll = (arr, values) => values.every(v => arr.includes(v));
```

```js
includesAll([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 4]); // true
includesAll([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5]); // false
```

## Check if array includes any values

Checks if at least one element of `values` is included in `arr`.

- Use `Array.prototype.some()` and `Array.prototype.includes()` to check if at least one element of `values` is included in `arr`.

```js
const includesAny = (arr, values) => values.some(v => arr.includes(v));
```

```js
includesAny([1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 9]); // true
includesAny([1, 2, 3, 4], [8, 9]); // false
```
